Got tired of that shitty thing where you have to put a bajillion "add listener" components
onto what you want. Here, you're just going to register your game object, as well as the 
events you want to listen to.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we have a good way of shoving hashes, so we have to
actually store the raw pointers, then check if they're valid all the time. Rough.

Got something online, I think it's decent, although it's not going to let me pass data
in these events. Hopefully that's fixable.

As I suspected, we're not removing the handlers when we die, which is really irritating.
This might be unusable.
